Hello friends, hope you are doing good. 
this is a simple code just to show you the resistor color code finder and value calculator using the color input.
In this code I have used simply the method which is originally used by us to find color codes as it is sometimes tedious... this is where we end. 
also in the second part of this code ther is a calculator by which you can get your value back by entering the color codes.
input steps:
1)First it will ask for you operation.
2)Than it will ask for the number of bands you want 
3)than you just have to enter your values or color codes for you desired output.
If you like it , do share this code. 
Thankyou for visiting!
